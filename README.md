### Hello, I'm Mary Lin 👋

I'm a technical writer and editor with 10+ years of experience working on user-friendly technical content. I love learning about new subjects and technologies, and my experience spans across:

- 💻 **Tech Education**: Edited and revised instructional content for cloud and DevOps courses and authored step-by-step lab guides to lead students through hands-on learning.
- ☁️ **Cloud Technology**: Worked with the AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud platforms and wrote documentation on services for each platform, as well as for Kubernetes, Docker, Linux, Ansible, and others.
- 📘 **Textbooks**: Reviewed, edited, and managed publication of textbooks and training manuals for the petroleum and energy industry.
- 📋 **Scientific and Medical Journals**: Managed publication of peer-reviewed scientific journals, preparing articles from initial submission to acceptance and final publication.
