### Hello, I'm Mary Lin 👋

I'm a technical writer and editor with 13+ years of experience working on user-friendly technical content. I love learning about new subjects and technologies, and my experience spans across:

- 💻 **Tech Education**: I authored step-by-step lab guides to lead students through hands-on learning. I also edited, updated, and maintained instructional content about cloud technology and DevOps.
- ☁️ **Cloud Technology**: I worked with the AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud platforms and wrote documentation on services for each platform, as well as for Kubernetes, Docker, Linux, and Ansible.
- 📘 **Textbooks**: I've reviewed, edited, and managed publication of textbooks and training manuals for the petroleum and energy industry.
- 📋 **Scientific and Medical Journals**: I have managed publication of peer-reviewed scientific journals, preparing articles from initial submission to acceptance and final publication.
- 📊 **Marketing**: I created infographics, author bios, press release notes, and web copy. I also worked on brochures, posters, flyers, email blasts, and other promotional material.
