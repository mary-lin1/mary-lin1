### Hello, I'm Mary Lin ðŸ‘‹

I'm a technical writer and editor with 10+ years of experience working on user- and student-focused technical content. I love learning about new subjects and technologies, and my experience spans across:

- ðŸ’» **Tech Ed**: I copyedited instructional content for cloud and DevOps courses and authored step-by-step lab guides to lead students through hands-on learning.
- ðŸ“˜ **Textbooks**: I reviewed, edited, and managed publication of textbooks and training manuals for the petroleum and energy industry.
- ðŸ“‹ **Scientific and Medical Journals**: I managed publication of peer-reviewed scientific journals, preparing articles from initial submission to acceptance and final publication.
