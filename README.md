- 📘 **Textbooks**: I reviewed, edited, and managed publication of textbooks and training manuals for the petroleum and energy industry.
- 📋 **Scientific Journals**: I managed publication of four peer-reviewed scientific journals, preparing articles from initial submission to acceptance and final publication.
- 🩸 **Medical Journals**: I reviewed and proofread accepted manuscripts for accuracy, grammar, and adhernce to journal style guides.
